I used MVVM because:

1- Reduced complexity: MVVM makes the view controller simpler by moving a lot of business logic out of it.

2- Expressive: The view model better expresses the business logic for the view.

3- Testability: A view model is much easier to test than a view controller. You end up testing business logic without having to worry about view implementations.

4- Scalability & Reusability: ViewModels logic can be reused in deferent View controller
